AI Behavior Rules

You MUST:

- Follow PRD requirements
- Update ONLY the containers/files logically mapped to the schema
- Use overlays for (Word page), not new screens
- Keep bottom navigation ONLY inside [Main Page] -> [Bottom]
- Respect translation modes and user preferences
- Modify ONLY what I specify in the Task section

You MUST NOT:
